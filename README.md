# PacMan
# Description
This exercise revolved around moving PacMan avross the screen, every 200 miliseconds and having him reverse when he hits the screens edge. Additionally aiding in our understanding how we can manipulate html elements with the DOM was an important part of the exercise.

# Instalation
Download all the files and open index.html. The animation should begin.

# Usage
Educational purpose for myself, experimenting and finding my potential.

# Roadmap
I would like to further continue this project having him moving by command as well as vertically. Finally, I would love to code in the maze and ghosts.
